(In that same novel Gulliver visits several other strange countries, and in a conversation with the King of Brobdingnag casually refers to the future United States as ""our plantations in America"".)

They would also suffocate because their need of oxygen is multiplied with 1728 but the inner surface of their lungs is multiplied only with 144.  If they could overcome those obstacles they would have to spend twelve times as much time as human beings ingesting food since their need for food is increased by a factor 1728, but the cross section of their esophagus, which determines their capacity to ingest food, only by 144.  If they could manage that they would still develop 1728 times as much heat, but they could shed it only through a surface that is 144 times as large as ours.

EOT ANS(num_cmp(-5/4));  TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));   \{htmlLink(""http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/ineq/"", ""Solving inequalities."")\}  You process inequalities like equalities, by doing the same thing on both sides of the inequality.  The main difference is that when you multiply with a negative number you reverse the inequality. For example, the inequality \[ 3x +2 < 5x -1 \] can be solved by subtracting \(5x\) and \(2\) on both sides, followed by a division by \(-2\), giving  \(x > \)  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.  Note that the inequality sign have been reversed.   EOT ANS(num_cmp(3/2));  TEXT(EV2(<<EOT));  \{htmlLink(""http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/abseq/"", ""Solving Equations involving absolute values."")\}  The basic principle is that every absolute value may equal the expression of which you take the absolute value, or  its negative.  For example, \(|x-2|\)  may equal \(x-2\) or \(-(x-2)\).  So you consider all possible combinations of the absolute values, and if there are a lot of them you reduce the number of cases judiciously.  For example, the equation \[|x-1|=|2x+1| \] has the obvious solution \(x=0\) and the  less obvious solution  \(x = \)  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.

Computing the intersection of two lines, graphically and algebraically.

If  \( s(t) \) is the position of the ball at time t (i.e. the height), \( v(t) \)  the velocity, and \( a(t) \) the acceleration, then:  \[   \begin{aligned}     v(t) & = s'(t) \\     a(t) & = v'(t) = s''(t)   \end{aligned} \]  So in our specific problem, we are reminded that the acceleration due to gravity is a constant 32 ft per second squared, in the negative direction. So, we know that \( a(t) = -32 \).  In order to find out how high the ball goes, we will need to first find out what the formula for instantaneous velocity looks like.  Using the relationship above, and the fact that the antiderivative of a constant \( D \) is \( Dx + C \) for another  constant \( C \), we get:  \[   v(t) = -32t + C_1 \]  To find the constant \( C_1 \), notice that we are told that the initial velocity of the ball is \(!{$initialSpeed}\) ft/sec. Therefore, \(v(0) = -32(0) + C_1 = C_1 = $initialSpeed\).  So, the formula for velocity is:  \[   v(t) = -32t + $initialSpeed \]  Now, we need to find the formula for the position of the ball.  This is \( s(t) \), the antiderivative of the velocity formula we just found.  Using the general rules for finding antiderivatives, we see that:  \[   s(t) = -16t^2 + {$initialSpeed}t + C_2 \]  Again, we need to find out what the constant, \( C_2 \) in this case, is equal to.  We can assume that the ball is shot from the ground, which is at height 0.  Therefore, the initial height of the ball, \( s(0) \), is 0 making the constant \( C_2 = 0 \).  Therefore, the final formula for position is:  \[   s(t) = -16t^2+{$initialSpeed}t \]  Finally, to find out how high the ball goes, we need to think about what happens when the ball reaches its maximum height.  At that point, the ball will pause for just an instant before starting to fall back to the ground. It that instant, the velocity of the ball is 0.  So, if we determine the time at which the ball has velocity 0, and then find its height at that time, we will know how high the ball goes. $PAR To find out when the velocity of the ball is 0, we set the velocity formula equal to 0 and compute as follows:  \[   \begin{aligned}     v(t) &= 0 \\     -32t + $initialSpeed &= 0 \\     32t &= $initialSpeed \\     t &= \frac{$initialSpeed}{32} = !{$topTime:%5.4f}   \end{aligned} \]  Therefore, the maximum height of the ball is:  \[   s(!{$topTime:%5.4f}) =   -16(!{$topTime:%5.4f})^2+{$initialSpeed}(!{$topTime:%5.4f}) = !{$height:%5.4f} \] ","['derivatives', 'distance', 'derivatives antiderivatives acceleration velocity', 'velocity', 'indefinite', 'acceleration', 'antiderivative', 'antiderivatives']"

The reason for the confusion is that division and multiplication have the same precedence and proceed from left to right unless otherwise indicated with parentheses.  Thus we divide by 2, and then multiply the result with a.  Also the scope of the division is only the square root since division comes before the addition to \(b\).

Then the depth of the well is  \{ ans_rule(30) \}  feet, where your answer depends on \(c\), \(g\), and \(t\).  $BBOLD Note:$EBOLD Thus you will have a formula that you can use to determine the depth of a well on any planet and in any atmosphere.

The latter is easy to determine,: \[t_s = \frac{d}{c}.\] The  equation governing the flight of the rock is \[h(t)  =-\frac{g}{2}t^2  + v_0 t + h_0.\]  In our case the original height and velocity are zero, and instead of height we are interested in depth, which is the negative of height. Hence,  when the rock reaches the bottom of the well we have that  \[h(t) = -\frac{g}{2}t_d^2 = -d.\] Thus \[t_d=\sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}}.\] We have to solve the equation \[t_s+t_d = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}} + \frac{d}{c} = t\] for \(d\). The key step is to recognize that  this is a  quadratic equation, not in \(d\) but in  the square root of \(d\).  Let's call it \(u\): \[u = \sqrt{d}\]  Then the equation turns into: \[t-\sqrt{\frac{2}{ g}} u - \frac{u^2}{ c} = 0.\] We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula. You may be comfortable doing that, and while I think that you are wasting your energy burdening your mind with arcane information like the quadratic formula, for the purposes of this assignment that's just fine. As for myself, I can never remember that formula, and memorizing formulas is error prone anyway. What if I misremember or misapply a formula? So in this discussion, we complete the square.  We obtain after multiplying with \(-c\) and rearranging:  \[\begin{array}{rcl} u^2 + \sqrt{\frac{2 }{  g} } cu - ct &=& 0 \\ u^2 + \sqrt{\frac{2 }{ g} }cu +  \frac{c^2}{ 2g} &=&  \frac{c^2}{ 2g}  + ct  \\ \left(u + \frac{1 }{  \sqrt{2g}}c \right)^2 &=&  ct + \frac{c^2 }{ 2g} \end{array} \] and therefore: \[u = - \frac{1  }{  \sqrt{2g}}c \pm \sqrt{   ct + \frac{c^2}{ 2g}}.\] We know that if \(t\) is 0 then \(d\), and therefore \(u\), must be 0 also. To get \(u=0\) we must choose the positive sign.  The solution with the negative sign is an artifact of solving a quadratic equation.  We also need to square on both sides of this equation to get \(d\).  After a slight rearrangement we obtain:  \[d = u^2 = \left( - \frac{ c }{  \sqrt{2g}} + \sqrt{\frac{c^2 }{ 2 g}  + ct} \right)^2.\]   This is the desired formula.   ",['algebra']

At that time the shuttle was traveling at approximately 1,568 mph (Mach 2.46) and was at an altitude of 66,000 feet. Based on film evidence, the foam traveled the 58-foot distance from the ramp to the wing in 0.16 seconds. Assuming a constant acceleration relative to the body of  the space shuttle of \{ans_rule(20)\} feet per second  EOT ANS(num_cmp( $a));   TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); squared, the foam hit the wing at a speed of \{ans_rule(20)\} feet per second,  EOT ANS(num_cmp( $v));  TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); or \{ans_rule(20)\} miles per hour. Unbeknownst to the astronauts and observers on earth, it struck the wing hard enough to cause the destruction of the Columbia two weeks later during re-entry on February 1, 2003. EOT  ANS(num_cmp( $V));    TEXT(EV2(<<EOT)); $PAR Note: A much more involved calculation estimated the speed of the impact to be about 530 mph.  $PAR Remember that ww expects your answer to be within one tenth of one percent of what it considers the true answer.  Calculate your answers based on the given data and assumptions to at least four digits. EOT  TEXT(EV3(<<'EOT'));   $BBOLD Hint:$EBOLD Figure everything relative to the moving space shuttle, i.e., the origin is traveling with the shuttle.  Acceleration is the derivative of velocity, and velocity is the derivative of displacement.  In this case, the acceleration is constant (by assumption), and the initial velocity and displacement are 0.  After 0.16 seconds the displacement is 58 feet.  There are 3,600 seconds in an hour, and 5280 feet in a mile.  As in many real problems, the problem statement contains extraneous information.  You have to decide what parts of the information are pertinent. EOT  SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));   $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Velocity \(v\) is the derivative of displacement \(d\), and acceleration \(a\) is the derivative of velocity.  If the acceleration is constant (and the initial velocity and displacement are 0), then \[v=at\] and \[s=\frac{1}{2} a t^2.\] Substituting \(s=58\) and \(t=1.6\) in the last equation allows us to solve for \[a = \frac{2s}{t} = \frac{2\times 58 }{0.16^2}\approx 4531\hbox{ft/sec}^2.\] (This is more than 140 times the acceleration caused by gravity.  The space shuttle itself was accelerating at only about 40 feet per second squared.  The large acceleration of that bulky and light weight foam was caused by the slip stream, despite the thin air at 66,000 feet.)  Multiplying that acceleration with the time of \(t=0.16\) seconds gives an impact velocity of 725 feet per second. Dividing by 5280 (feet per mile) and multiplying by 3,600 (seconds per hour) gives a speed of 494.3 miles per hour.  That's remarkably close to the ""official"" estimate of 530 mph.

This relationship is given by:  \[   \begin{array}     v(t)  = s'(t) \\     a(t)  = v'(t) = s''(t) \\   \end{array} \]  With this in mind, this problem becomes an exercise in finding antideriviatives.  We are told that the the acceleration due to gravity  is -32 feet per second squared, so that the function \( a(t) = -32 \).   Throughout this problem, it is important to remember which way is up.  That  is, negative values mean the object is accelerating or moving down, positive  values mean it is accelerating or moving up.  With this in mind, we need to compute the formula for the velocity of the stone at time \( t \).  Since the acceleration function is \( a(t) = -32 \), the velocity function is the general antiderivative of this, or \( v(t) = -32t + C_1 \) where \( C_1 \) is a  constant.  We are told that the initial speed of the stone is $v1 feet per second. Therefore, \( v(0) = -32(0) + C_1 = $v1 \Rightarrow C_1 = $v1 \).  Hence, the  formula for the instantaneous velocity at time \( t \) is \( v(t) = -32t+$v1 \).  Finally, we need to find a formula for the position of the stone at time \( t \). Taking the antiderivative of the velocity, we get \( s(t) = -16t^2+{$v1}t+C_2 \)  where \( C_2 \) is again an unknown constant.  However, we are told that the height  of the building, and thus the initial height of the stone (we can assume that the  person doing the throwing is arbitrarily short) is $s1 feet.  Therefore,  \( s(0) = -16(0)^2 + {$v1}(0) + C_2 = $s1 \Rightarrow C_2 = $s1 \).  And, our  formula for position at time \(t\) is \(s(t) = -16t^2+{$v1}t+$s1 \).  Putting this all to gether to answer the three questions posed, we get the following answers:  \[   \begin{array}     \mbox{A. } s($t1)  = -16($t1)^2 + {$v1}($t1) + $s1 = $ans1 \\     \\     \mbox{B. } s(t)  = -16t^2 + {$v1}t + $s1 = 0 \\               t  = \frac{-$v1 - \sqrt{($v1)^2-4(-16)($s1)}}{2(-16)} \\                  = $ans2 \\     \\     \mbox{C. } v($ans2)  = -32($ans2) + $v1 \\                         = $ans3 \\   \end{array} \] ","['distance', 'derivatives antiderivatives acceleration velocity', 'velocity', 'acceleration', 'antiderivatives']"

(To write the solution of this problem I did very little beyond taking the solution of the previous problem and replacing 600 with \(d\) throughout.)    You shoot an arrow at an angle of 45 degrees.

EOT  SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));   $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD Suppose \(v\) is the speed of the arrow. Since the initial horizontal and vertical speeds are the same we have \[V=v_v(0) = v_h(0) =v\cos45^\circ= \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}.\] Since the initial height is zero we have \[h(t) = -16t^2+Vt.\] Solving \(h(t)=0\) gives the time of impact: \[t_{\hbox{impact}} = \frac{V}{16}.\] During that time the arrow covers a distance of \(d\) feet at the speed \(V\).  This gives \[\frac{V^2}{16} = d\] or \[V=\sqrt{16\times d}\quad\hbox{feet/second}.\] We need to multiply with \(\sqrt{2}\) to get the speed \(v\), and we need to convert from feet per second to miles per hour.

Estimate the amount of aluminum that could be saved if the cans were designed with the ratio \(d/h=1\), while having the same volume as the standard 12oz can.

EOT  ANS(num_cmp((48/(3.14159265*$t))**(1/3)));   SOLUTION(EV3(<<'EOT'));   $BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD    For completeness let me recall how we optimized the can.   The volume \(V\) and the area \(A\) of our cans is given by \[V= \pi r^2 h = {\pi\over 4} d^2 h \quad\hbox{and}\quad A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh = \pi \left({d^2\over 2} + dh\right) \] where \(r\) is the radius of the can.  The standard way of approaching this problem would be to use the volume formula to express \(d\) or \(h\) in terms of the other, substitute in the area formula, differentiate the area with respect to the remaining variable (\(h\) or \(d\), respectively), find out where the derivative is zero, then compute the previously eliminated variable, and finally compute the optimum ratio.  We expect that ratio to be independent of the volume of the can.  In other words, the optimal $BITALIC shape$EITALIC of the can should be independent of its volume. We used this approach in class on Monday, and it works just fine.  However, just to illustrate another possibility, let's approach the problem more directly.  Let's give a name  \[\alpha = {d \over h}  \] to the quantity we want to find, and express everything directly in terms of that quantity, \(\alpha\).  It follows that \[d = \alpha h \quad\hbox{and thus} \quad V= {\pi \alpha^2 \over 4} h^3. \] Hence \[h^3 = {4V \over \pi\alpha^2} \quad\hbox{and}\quad h = \left({4V \over \pi}\right)^{1/3} \alpha ^{-2/3}. \] We also obtain \[d = \alpha\left({4V\over \pi}\right)^{1/3} \alpha ^ {-2/3} = \left({4V\over \pi}\right)^{1/3} \alpha ^ {1/3}. \]  Hence the area that we want to minimize is given by \[A = \pi \left({1\over 2} \left({4V\over \pi}\right)^{2/3} \alpha ^{2/3} +\left({4V\over \pi}\right)^{2/3}\alpha^{1/3}\alpha^{-2/3}\right) \] \[ = \pi \left({4V\over \pi}\right)^{2/3}\left({1\over 2} \alpha^{2/3} + \alpha^{-1/3}\right). \] For this expression to be minimized, the factor containing \(\alpha\), i.e., \[F(\alpha) = {1\over 2} \alpha^{2/3} + \alpha^{-1/3} \] must be minimized. Differentiating and setting the derivative to zero gives \[F'(\alpha) = {1\over 3} \alpha^{-1/3} - {1\over 3} \alpha^{-4/3} =  {\alpha^{-4/3}\over 3} (\alpha -1 ) =0. \] The best ratio \(\alpha\) is clearly some positive real number, so the only critical point is \[{\alpha = {d \over h} = 1} \] and so those optimal cans are as tall as they are wide.    Now let's turn to the potential savings of aluminum.   Clearly, the cans used in the US do not have what we computed as the $BITALIC optimal shape$EITALIC in the preceding problem.  Since we figure the savings as a percentage of the total amount of aluminum used currently we can work with the function \(F\) rather than the area itself.  For the common cans \[\alpha = { d \over h} = {2.75 \over 5} = {11\over 20}.\]  For that value \[F(\alpha) = {1\over 2} \left({11\over 20}\right)^{2/3} + \left({11\over 20}\right)^{-1/3} \approx 1.5562. \] On the other hand, the minimum value of \(F\) is \[F(1) = {1\over 2} + 1 = 1.5. \] Therefore the potential savings \(p\) figured as an approximate percentage are \[p=100 \times {1.5562 - 1.5 \over 1.5} = 3.74\hbox{percent}. \] We could only save a little less than 4$PERCENT of the aluminum using those optimal cans, and of course there are other considerations like attractiveness as a drinking vessel and similarly arcane marketing and consumer appeal considerations.  Besides, it would cost a vast amount of money to reconfigure the existing infrastructure of manufacturing and distributing equipment at this stage.  Still, 4$PERCENT of the aluminum used in this country to make cans is a lot of aluminum!   ",['calculus']

She is interested in how the artifact will respond to  faster variations in temperature, so she kidnaps the artifact,  takes it back to her lab (hotly pursued by the military police who patrol Area 51), and sticks it in an ""oven"" -- that is, a closed box whose temperature she can control precisely.    Let \(T(t)\) be the temperature of the artifact. Newton's law of cooling says that \(T(t)\) changes at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of  the environment and the temperature of the artifact. This says that there is a constant \(k\), not dependent on time, such that  \( T' = k(E - T) \), where \(E\) is the temperature of the environment (the oven).      Before collecting the artifact from the desert, Susan measured its temperature at a couple of times, and she has determined that for  the alien artifact,  \(k = $k\).      Susan preheats her oven to \($E\) degrees  Fahrenheit (she has stubbornly refused to join the metric world).  At time \( t = 0\) the oven is at exactly \($E\) degrees and is heating up,  and  the oven runs through a temperature cycle every \(2 \pi \) minutes,  in which its temperature varies by \($V\) degrees above and \($V\)  degrees below \($E\) degrees.    Let \(E(t)\)  be the temperature of the oven after \(t \) minutes.  \( E(t) = \) \{ ans_rule(70) \}    At time \(t = 0\), when the artifact is at a temperature of \($starttemp\) degrees, she puts it in the oven. Let \( T(t)\) be the temperature of the artifact at time \( t\). Then \(T(0) = \) \{ans_rule(15) \} (degrees)    Write a differential equation which models the temperature of the artifact.  \(T' = f( t , T ) = \)  \{ans_box(3,60)\}. $BBOLD Note: $EBOLD Use \( T \) rather than \( T(t) \) since the latter confuses the computer.

Yes, you get an \(x^2\) term.   The sum of two cubic polynomials cannot have a degree greater than 3.  That's true since adding does not change the exponents. When adding numbers we can trade low powers of 10 for higher powers of 10, but the analog is not true for polynomials.   The sum of two cubic polynomials may have a degree less than 3. Yes, if the leading terms cancel.  For example, \[(x^3+1) +(- x^3 )= 1.\] The sum has degree 0.   The sum of a cubic and a quartic polynomial may have a degree different from 4.  No.  The cubic polynomial cannot change the leading term of the quartic polynomial.   The product of two monomial is a monomial.  yes - the new exponent is the sum of the two original exponents.   The product of two binomial is a binomial.  Not in general, although for example \[(x+1)(x-1) = x^2-1.\] So in this case the product is a binomial.

Also assume that you bearing from the ship is \(\beta\) and your distance is \(d\).  Then the direction in which you move is 270 degrees plus an angle \(\alpha\).  Let \(a\) and \(b\) denote the east/west and north/south components of your distance from the ship, as indicated in the Figure.  Furthermore, let \(x\) be the distance that the ship covers before you catch up with it.  You yourself cover a distance \[y= \frac{v_2}{v_1} x.\]  We are done if we can figure out the angle \(\alpha\).  So we need to set up some equations.  We obtain directly from the Figure:  \[a=d \cos\left(\beta-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = d\sin\beta,\] \[b=d \sin\left(\beta-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -d\cos\beta,\] and \[(x+a)^2+b^2 = {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2\]   The third of these equations is a quadratic equation for \(x\), and we can solve it by completing the square:  \[\begin{array}{rclcl} (x+a)^2+b^2 &=& {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2  &|& \hbox{expand} \\ \\ x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2 &=& {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2  &|& -{\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2 \\ \\ x^2+2ax+a^2+b^2 - {\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}} x^2 &=& 0 &|& \hbox{simplify} \\ \\ (1-{\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}}) x^2 +2ax + d^2 &=& 0  &|& \times (-1) \\ \\ ({\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}}-1) x^2 -2ax - d^2 &=& 0  &|& \gamma={\frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}}-1 \\ \\ \gamma x^2 -2ax - d^2 &=& 0  &|& \div \gamma \\ \\  x^2 -\frac{2a}{\gamma}x - \frac{d^2}{\gamma} &=& 0  &|& +\frac{d^2}{\gamma}+\left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 \\ \\  x^2 -\frac{2a}{\gamma}x +\left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &=& \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &|&\hbox{perfect square}  \\ \\ \left(x-\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &=&  \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2 &|& \sqrt{~~~} \\ \\ x-\frac{a}{\gamma} &=&\pm\sqrt{  \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2} &|& + \frac{a}{\gamma} \\ \\ x &=&\frac{a}{\gamma}\pm\sqrt{  \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2} &|&  \\ \\ \end{array} \]  Of these two solutions one is negative (query: why?) and so we need to consider only the solution with the plus sign:  \[x=\frac{a}{\gamma}+\sqrt{ \frac{d^2}{\gamma}+ \left(\frac{a}{\gamma}\right)^2}\]  which allows us to compute \(x\) by substituting the expressions  \(a= d\sin\beta\).

2521,['algebra']," This first question is just an exercise in entering answers into WeBWorK.  It also gives you an opportunity to experiment with entering different  \{htmlLink(""http://www.math.utah.edu/online/1010/algebra"", ""arithmetic and algebraic expressions"")\} into WeBWorK and seeing what WeBWorK really thinks you are doing (as opposed to what you believe it should think).    Notice the buttons on this page and try them out before moving to the next problem.  Use the ""Back"" Button on your browser to get back here when needed.      ""Prob. List"" gets you back to the list of all problems in this set.   ""Next"" gets you to the next question in this set.   ""Submit Answer"" submits your answer as you might expect, but there may be other ways to do so. Specifically, in this problem, there is only one question.  In that case you can submit your answer by typing it into the answer window and then pressing ""Return"" (or ""Enter"") on your keyboard.  But even in this case, you can also type the answer and click on the ""submit"" button.  There is no harm in submitting an answer even if you are not quite sure that it's correct, since if it is not you have an unlimited number of additional tries.  On the other hand, it is usually more efficient to print your own private problems set, work out the answers in a quiet environment like your home, and then sit down in front of a computer and enter your answers.  If some are wrong you can try to fix them right at the computer, or you may want to go back and work on them quietly elsewhere before returning to the computer.   Pressing on the ""Preview Answer"" Button makes WeBWorK display what it thinks you entered in the answer window. After using ""Preview"" you can modify your answer and use a ""Preview Again"" button.   ""images"" denotes the ordinary display mode on your workstation.   ""Logout"" terminates this WeBWorK session for you.  You can of course log back in and continue.   ""Feedback"" enables you to send a message to your instructor,  and the WeBWorK assistants.  If you use this way of sending e-mail the recipients receive information about your WeBWorK state, in addition to your actual message.   The ""Help"" Button transports you to an official WeBWorK help page that has a  more information than this first problem.   ""Problem Sets""  transports you back to the page where you can select a certain problem set.  When you do this particular problem in this first set, there is only one set, but eventually there will be 13 of them.   For all problems in this course you will be able to see the $BBOLD Answers $EBOLD to the problems $BBOLD after the due date $EBOLD .  Go to a  problem, click on ""show correct answers"", and then click on ""submit answer"".  You can also download and print a hard copy with the answers showing.  These answers are the precise strings against which WeBWorK compares your answer.  If the answer is an algebraic expression your answer needs to be equivalent to the WeBWorK answer, but it may be in a different form.  For example if WeBWorK thinks the answer is \(2*a\), it is OK for you to type \(a+a\) instead.  If WeBWorK expects a numerical answer then you can usually enter it as an arithmetic expression (like \(1/7\) instead of \(.142857\)), and usually WeBWorK will expect your answer to be within one tenth of one percent of what it thinks the answer is.   Most of the problems (including this one) in this course will also have solutions attached that you can see after the due date by clicking on ""show solutions"" followed by ""submit answers"".  The solutions are text typed by your instructor that gives more information than the ""answers"", and in particular often explains how the answers can be obtained.         Now for the meat of this problem.  Notice that the answer window is extra large so you can try the things suggested above.   $BBOLD Type the number 3 here: $EBOLD  \{ ans_rule(50) \}.    $BBOLD Try entering other expressions and use the preview button to see  what  WeBWorK thinks you entered.  Return to this problem to try out things when you get stuck somewhere else. $EBOLD   Here are some good examples to try.  Check them all out using the Preview button.  (In later questions on this set you will get to use what you learn here.)  Never mind that you may have already answered the correct answer 3.  Once you get credit for an answer it won't be taken away by trying other answers.    a/2b  ~~~versus~~~  a/2/b    ~~~versus~~~  a/(2b)    a/b+c ~~~versus~~~ a/(b+c)    a+b**2 ~~~versus~~~  (a+b)**2    sqrt a+b ~~~versus~~~ sqrt(a+b)   4/3 pi r**2  ~~~versus~~~ (4/3) pi r**2   (In other words, if you are not sure use parentheses freely.)  Note: WeBWorK will not usually let you enter algebraic expressions when the answer is a number, and it will only let you use certain variables when the answer is in fact an algebraic expression.  So the above window, and the $BBOLD opportunity for experimentation $EBOLD that  it offers is unique.  Make good use of it!    Presumably this has been your first encounter with WeBWorK.

The axis of rotation is shown as a red line.  This will help you be sure you pictured or graphed the situation accurately:  $graphtext    Example 4 on p.444 can help remind you how to do this type of problem, if it's been awhile since you've done rotation problems to calculate volume. The idea is that each vertical slice of the object is a thick ring, that is, a circle with an inner circle missing.  So its area can be calculated by (area of outer circle) - (area of inner circle), which simplifies to \(\pi\left(r_{outer}^2-r_{inner}^2\right)\).    So in this situation, the upper boundary of the region forms the outer edge of the surface, because we're rotating about an axis below the region.  Thus the outer radius at point \(x\) is expressed by \(\cos($b x)+$a\), because that is the distance from the axis of rotation to the x-axis plus the distance from the x-axis to the top of the region (at point \(x\)).

2693,"['differentiation', 'optimization']"," BEGIN_TEXT  $PAR  The blood vascular system consists of blood vessels (arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins) that convey blood from the heart to the organs and back to the heart. This system should work so as to minimize the energy expended by the heart in pumping the blood. In particular, this energy is reduced when the resistance of the blood is lowered. One of Poiseuille's Laws gives the resistance R of the blood as  $PAR  \(R= C \dfrac{L}{r^2} \)  $PAR  where L is the length of the blood vessel, r is the radius, and C is a positive constant determined by the viscosity of the blood.

The vertical edge of that triangle forms the the height of the pyramid and has a length of 482 feet.  The horizontal edge of that triangle has a length that equals half the length of the base of the pyramid, i.e., 378 feet.  Thus your climbing angle is \[\arctan\left(\frac{482}{378}\right) \approx 51.90^\circ.\] If you start  in a corner of the base you get another triangle with the same vertical edge, but a horizontal edge of length \(\sqrt{378^2+378^2}\). Thus the corresponding angle is  \[\arctan\left(\frac{482}{\sqrt{378^2+378^2}}\right) \approx  42.04^\circ.\] The length \(L\) of the ridge going to the top can be obtained by applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice.

But mathematicians have found things like \(3^0\) and \(9^{\frac{1}{2}}\) to be useful   and they used a very important technique to find a reasonable way to deal with them.    Since this method will arise in several topics you will study in middle and high school,  we will explain it in detail. $PAR The trick is to find an explanation other than   "" the number of copies of the base to multiply together"" for the exponent  in such a way that it will give the same result on the things we  already know   and enable us to use exponents that are not positive integers. $PAR Suppose we let the positive number \(b\) be the base and make the  following definition:  Rule 1: \(b^1=b\)    Rule 2: \(b^{n+1}=b^n\cdot b\) $PAR This definition must look strange to you so let us use it to find \(5^3\).    The base is \(5\) so we can use Rule 1 to say that \(5^1=5\).   Now that we know what \(5^1\) is we can use Rule 2 to say that \(5^2=5^{1+1}=5^1\cdot 5 =5\cdot 5=25\).    Next we can use Rule 2 to say \(5^3=5^{2+1}=5^2\cdot 5 =25\cdot 5=125\).    This is much uglier than just saying that \(5^3=5\cdot 5\cdot 5\). But now we can do some neat tricks with it. $PAR Notice that in Rule 2 we did not say that n had to be a positive integer.   So we will use the definition to find out what \(5^0\) has to be.   But you can do some of the work. $PAR  We know from rule 1 that \(5^1=5\).   From Rule 2 we can say That \(5^{0+1}=5^{0}\cdot 5\).

You  can use the same technique that \(7^0=1\).    Now you are probably tempted to believe that if \(n\) is any number then \(n^0=1\).  But that is false and let us see why.  Let's try to see what \(0^0\)  must be. $PAR Certainly we can use Rule 1 to say that \(0^1=0\). Now we use Rule 2 to say \(0^{0+1}=0^0\cdot 0\).    This tells us that \(0=0^0\cdot 0\).  But, unfortunately this tells us nothing since if we multiply any  number by 0 we get 0.   So these rules do not tell us what \(0^0\) should be. $PAR Well, you may say, we should use common sense to figure out what  \(0^0\) has to be. $PAR You might say $PAR  Claim 1:  If for any positive number n, \(n^0=1\) then \(0^0\)  should be 1. $PAR Now let's see what is wrong with this reasoning.  First, we know that \(0^1=0\).$ Notice that \(0^2\) (the result of multiplying two zeros together) is also \(0\). In fact, \(0^n=0\) for any positive integer \(n\).  So you could say $PAR  Claim 2:  If for any positive number n, \(0^n=0\) then \(0^0\) should be 0.  The two claims are equally strong, and it turns out that there is no reasonable way to define \(0^0\). $PAR Now we will go a few steps further.

Using the same reasoning you can see that positive integer powers satisfy: $PAR Rule 3: \(b^m\cdot b^n=b^{m+n}\). $PAR If you think a bit about what you have done with negative integer powers you can see that this rule works for them too.   So we will add Rule 3  to our rules for exponents (so that it applies to all exponents).$PAR This may worry you a bit.  How can we just make up such rules?  Well, since we have no way to interpret powers that are not positive integers, in terms of multiplying copies of the base together  and since the rule works when in the case of positive integers, we are making an extension and can only judge whether it is useful.   $PAR Now we will look at what happens when we extend this rule to the situation in which \(m \)and \(n \) are permitted to be fractions.

Notice that all the example says is that if we multiply six fives together that is the same thing as multiplying the product of three fives by itself.

Another way of saying the same thing is that \((5^{\frac{1}{2}})^2=5\) and this means that  \(5^{\frac{1}{2}\times 2}=5\) $PAR Using this second approach we can see that  \(5^{\frac{1}{3}\times 3}=5\). This tells us that \(5^{\frac{1}{3}}\) is a number whose third power is 5. The mathematical notation for this is \(\root 3 \of 5\)  and it is called the cube root of 5 or the third root of 5.

This is just a very short cylinder, so its volume is:   \( dV = \pi r^2 dx \).   We know r, the radius of the pool, is a constant, \(r= $r\). Now that we have the volume of an arbitrary cross-section of the water, we need to find the force which is exerted on the volume. That force is nothing more than the weight. The constant \( \sigma \) gives us weight-per-volume of the liquid. Therefore, by multipling the volume of the slice by \( \sigma \), we find:   \( dF = \sigma \pi r^2 dx \)   Since Work (W) is given by:   \( W = Fx = F\int_{a}^{b}xdx \)   in the case of a constant force F, all that remains is to find an expression for \( D\), the distance each slice of water is lifted. If we consider the top of the pool as x=0, $h-$d is the distance to the surface of the water, since the height of the pool is $h, and the depth is $d. So we have the distance x from x=$h-$d until x=$h. This results in the integral:   \[ W = \int_{$h-$d}^{$h} \sigma \pi r^2 xdx \]   which is simple to evaluate.","['work', 'water pressure']"

We find the second-order partials: \[f_{xx}(x,y)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left($fx\right)=$fxx\]  \[f_{yy}(x,y)=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left($fy\right)=$fyy\]  \[f_{xy}(x,y)=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left($fx\right)=$fxy\]  The discriminant is thus \[D(x,y)=f_{xx}f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2=$fxx \cdot \left($fyy\right)-\frac{1}{(x+y)^4}=$disc\] $PAR Applying the Second Derivative Test we have \[D\left($x,$y0\right)=$d0<0\] We conclude that \(f\left($x,$y0\right)\) is a saddle point.",['calculus']
3684,"['integer', 'ones complement', 'binary']","One's complement representations of integers are used to simplify computer  arithmetic. To represent positive and negative integers with absolute value less than \( 2^{n-1} \), a total of \( n \) bits is used.  The leftmost bit is used to represent the sign: this bit is 0 for  positive integers and 1 for negative integers.   For positive integers, the remaining bits are identical to  the binary representation of the integer. Thus using 4 bits, the  One's complement representation of 5 is 0101.   For negative integers, the remaining bits are found by first  finding the binary representation of the absolute value of the integer  and then taking the complement of each of these bits in the binary  representation. (Thus 1's and 0's get switched)   Thus for example using 4 bits, the One's complement representation of  -5 is 1010, where the initial 1 is to indicate the sign, and the subsequent 010 is the complement of 101 the binary representation of 5.

With the substitution \[x = {$a}\tan(\theta)\] \[dx = {$a}\sec^2(\theta) \; d\theta\]  Therefore: \[\int  \frac{ dx}{x^2\sqrt{$a2 + x^2}}= \int  \frac{{$a}\sec^2\theta }{{$a2}\tan^2\theta\sqrt{$a2 + $a2\tan^2\theta}}\;d\theta\] \[= \int  \frac{{$a}\sec^2\theta }{{$a3}\tan^2\theta\sec\theta}\;d\theta\] \[= \int  \frac{\sec\theta }{{$a2}\tan^2\theta}\;d\theta\] \[= \int  \frac{\cos\theta }{{$a2}\sin^2\theta}\;d\theta\]   We have an odd power of the cosine, so we use a sine substitution.

The values of \(a, c\), and \(p\) all must be positive since all three of the graphs cross the \(y\)-axis when \(y > 0 \). $PAR b) Only the value for \($fact[0]\) must be greater than 1 since the graph of \( $lt[0] \) is increasing.  If an exponential is increasing, its base must be greater than 1.  None of the other constants MUST be greater than 1. $PAR c) The values for \($fact[1]\) and \($fact[2]\) certainly are between 0 and 1 since the graphs of \( $lt[1] \) and \( $lt[2] \) are decreasing.  In addition, it is possible that all of the \(y\)-intercepts are between 0 and 1.  They must be positive, and they may be greater than 1, but they do not have to be greater than 1.  Thus it is certainly possible that they are between 0 and 1.  Therefore the constants \($fact[1]\), \($fact[$perm[2]]\), \($init[0]\), \($init[1]\), and \($init[2]\) could possibly be between 0 and 1 (while in part (b) we already stated that $fact[0] > 1). $PAR d) The constant \($init[1]\) denotes the value of the \(y\)-intercept of the graph of \( $lt[1] \).  All we can definitely say about the value of \($init[1]\) is that it must be positive (as all of the constants must be), and it must be greater than the values of \($init[0]\) and \($init[2]\) since \( $lt[1] \) has a \(y\)-intercept which is higher than the \(y\)-intercepts of \( $lt[0] \) and \( $lt[2] \).  It is possible that all of the bases \($fact[0]\), \($fact[1]\), and \($fact[2]\) are greater than \($init[1]\). $PAR e) Since the \(y\)-intercepts of \( $lt[0] \) and \( $lt[2] \) are equal, we definitely know that \($init[0] = $init[2]\).
